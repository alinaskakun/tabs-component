# Task for the Victorinox Project

The task - is to create a reusable “tabs” component.

### Requirements:

- Design is up to you.
- The component should be as flexible as possible. As it is expected to be a reusable component, we can’t predict all the use cases.	
- The component should be extensible. I.e., when we want to add a new feature, the component must be easily extended. 
- Min screen width: 320px. 
- Max screen width: infinity. 
- WCAG accessibility level: AAA (https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance). You can use “AXE DevTools” chrome extension to check the accessibility. 
- It would be a benefit to organize the solution as a GitHub repository represented as a UI components library with Storybook.
